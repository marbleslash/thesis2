If the collection agency is managing the account receivables for a creditor, they may call to advise you of payment terms, due dates, etc., but they should not ask you for early payment. You should receive a statement before you are asked to make a payment. Generally, the creditor does not have to tell you before it sends your debt to a debt collector, but a creditor usually will try to collect the debt from you before sending it to a collector.With mortgage loans, usually the company servicing your mortgage loan is also the company that will contact you to collect the payment if your loan becomes delinquent. If your mortgage servicer changes, both your old and new servicers must notify you of the transfer. The company transferring the servicing rights must provide you with a notice not less than 15 days before the effective date of the transfer and your new servicer must deliver a transfer notice not more than 15 days after the effective transfer date.

He told my father that he was going to have me arrested and would charge me with criminal charges. When I finally was able to get in contact with someone ( they have a very impenetrable phone system ), the man who answered told me I was wasting my time calling without an attorney and they would see me in court. He kept cutting me off and telling me I was willfully trying to fraud the lender. When he eventually stopped talking long enough for me to get a declarative sentence out, he transferred me to a female collection agent who told me I had to pay with only a debit or credit card. After taking my information, and setting up XXXX payments for half of the balance, she hung up. I tried calling back several times. I then attempted to contact the next day where the original gentleman who contacted my father told me I had better let all of those payments I set up go through or they would "" see me in court and charge me with criminal charges ''.

XXXX obviously sent the alleged debt off to a different debt collection company when the first was not successful. Again, I asked in writing for validation of the debt from this second company as required by law. The validation failed to identify the debt 's particulars in order for me to determine if it was a valid debt.

Cont'd attempts collect debt not owed,2328247,"I have already submitted a complaint about this company in XX/XX/XXXX but they have not replied, case number XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX I began having XXXX ( XXXX ) monitor my home security system on a month to month basis. I used them for two years but when the rental home that I was living in went up for sale it was impossible to set the alarm. So XX/XX/XXXX I called to cancel services and was told I had to do it in writing. When I asked where to send the certified letter the receptionist explained they do not accept certified letters and I needed to send it US first class mail. So as instructed, I sent the letter with the account number and address to cancel. Before moving we forwarded the mail and our phone numbers have never changed. After mailing my last payment I never heard from the company again. Until XX/XX/XXXX when I received a call from a collections agent after asking me if I was XXXX XXXX ( only qualifier no second proof of ID ) she told me that I had a charge off for {$600.00} and if I did not pay it right away it would impact my credit. I told her that this must be a mistake the debt could not be mine. She explained where the debt was bought from and I denied I owed anything. She then started reading off my full social security number without being sure she was really talking to me just to prove she had my information. I called XXXX immediately and was informed that no one at the office could help but the operator told me she would send a message to the department that can and I would have to wait for a call back. After 3 days with no call, I called back again to get the same story. They would not give me a number to call directly but only offered to send another message. I sent an e-mail to the collections agent asking for more information and any proof this was a valid dept. They sent me the month to month agreement I signed in XXXX but no breakdown of the charges and no proof of any attempt to collect. I do not see this as proof I owe anything especially knowing that I canceled the service. After three weeks with no call from the company I filed a BBB complaint hoping it would force someone to acknowledge me. They replied to it stating I was currently in collections and they were not at liberty to discuss anything with me until the collection has been resolved. They did not respond to any of your inquires. The collections agency did answer the Consumer affairs complaint that I submitted in XX/XX/XXXX and states they were allowed to collect the full term of the contract, up to 2 years ( I had service from XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX how could they still have 16 months worth of contract left? ) I was told there was no term limit and could cancel at anytime. The agreement I signed did not say anything about two years of service required. We choose this company in the beginning because of no contract and flexibility in cancellation if necessary. I believe the practices of this business intentionally lead to collections. I believe they have mislead the collections company too, I think the collectors are just trying to collect the debt that they think they bought. There is no contract only the month to month agreement I have submitted with the first complaint and with this one. I spoke with someone from the XXXX XXXX consumer assistance group and they told me they hear this all the time that security companies in XXXX do this a lot. According to the reviews on-line I am not the only renter that they bill like this. I believe that they violated FCRA laws by selling this invalid debt. Please follow up this matter, I believe this is an abuse of consumers in the XXXX Area.

You can also ask for additional information, but the collector may not be obligated to provide that information to you. You should make a copy of your letter and send the original to the debt collector. It is generally a good idea to send the letter by certified mail. If you pay for a ""return receipt,"" you also will have proof the debt collector received your letter. You may also send the letter by fax. Just be sure to keep a copy of the fax receipt. Don't ignore debt collectors. Ignoring or avoiding a debt collector may not make the collector stop contacting you or stop trying to collect the debt. You should tell the debt collector if you believe you do not owe the debt, or that the debt is not yours, or that there is some other problem with the debt, such as an incorrect amount. Even if the debt is yours, you still have the right not to talk to the debt collector and you can tell the debt collector to stop contacting you. If the collector continues to call after receiving the letter, they may be violating the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). It is also against the law for a debt collector to use unfair, deceptive or abusive practices in an attempt to collect debt from you. You can also sue the debt collector for violating the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). If you sue under the FDCPA and win, the debt collector must generally pay your attorney's fees, and may also have to pay you damages."
Attempts to collect debt not owed,3463820,"After purchasing my first house 6 years ago I started receiving debt notices for debt that was not mine. I've never had a problem with credit card debt and have no student loans. After calling the original creditor I discovered that I shared the exact same name as the person who owed the debt, but they understood and removed me from their system. For 4 years I would receive notices randomly from different debt collection agencies. My assumption was that this debt had been sold to several other debt collectors. Whenever I called to explain they had the wrong person and address each one stopped sending notices. About 3 years ago my wife got a call from a Sheriff 's officer. The man with my exact same name had died and the system listed my wife 's phone number as contact. Luckily I was at the house when she received this call and the Sheriff was very apologetic for the mistake. After this the debt notices stopped. To my recollection maybe one or two more came in the mail but as soon as I called the number listed, the collector could easily XXXX the man 's name, find his obituary, and remove me from their system. Two weeks ago FAMS INC started sending me notices in the mail, but whenever I call to explain the situation they will not listen. They continue to send me notices and offering settlements even though I can point them to this man 's obituary. After sharing that information with them they claim there is nothing they can do. They continually send me notices and treat me as if I'm lying if I call the number listed. They've asked for my social security number and date of birth multiple times. I have never shared that because I fear they are trying to burden me with this now deceased man 's debt whom I have no relation to at all aside from sharing a very common name.","Customer has a history of being mistaken by collection agencies for another man of the same name. Generally, once the customer notifies that they have the wrong person and address, these agencies would discontinue from sending notices. However, FAMS INC has been sending notices for this other manÕs debt. No matter how many times the customer explains the situation to them (even pointing to the other manÕs obituary), FAMS INC ignores, claiming there is nothing they can do and continues to pursue the debt, even venturing as far as asking for the customerÕs social security number and date of birth.
